Not good.<br>
Not good.<br>
Separated.<br>
Gone.<br>
Strange things, everywhere.<br>
<br>
I AM<br>
<b>TRYING</b><br>
TO UNDERSTAND THIS<br>
<br>
breathe.<br>
deric.<br>
you need to breathe.<br>
<br>
this is just a story, sure, it’s one where you COULD DIE--<br>
<br>
if it’s just a story, you’re the good guy, right?<br>
<br>
the good guys win, right?<br>
<br>
shit.<br>
<br>
a piano in the woods.<br>
<br>
god. that’s really the thing i’m scared of.<br>
why wouldn’t I? with everything that’s happened the last few hours.<br>
… it’s only been a few hours?<br>
<br>
A rustling. Someone else is here.<br>
I move behind some brush.<br>
<br>
“-- but I don’t see how they’re gonna beat us, yeah?”<br>
“Chamel. We don’t know what they can do. We can’t just say something like that.”<br>
“Can they stop bullets?”<br>
A pause. “You tell me.”<br>
A longer pause.<br>
“Hey, what is that?”<br>
<br>
“Hey!” I call out (not moving so as to not startle them).<br>
I hear a gun cock.<br>
<br>
“Who’s there?” one of them -- not Chamel? -- says.<br>
<br>
“Woah! Okay, uh, I’m Deric, I’m not one of the… whatever those things are.”<br>
“Get out of the bush,” the same one says.<br>
“Alright, alright.” I slowly move into view. “Hi.” I point at the piano. “Do not touch that.”<br>
“The piano? Why not?” Chamel says.<br>
“Why the hell would you?! You don’t go towards random shit in the woods! With everything that’s going on?! That’s how you die.”<br>
“Oh, please. It’s just a piano.”<br>
I turn towards not-Chamel. “How is he alive?”<br>
“I don’t know.”<br>
“Hey, look, I’m gonna play it, alright?” Chamel says, having moved towards the piano.<br>
“Chamel, no, you dense fuck, don’t do it,” not-Chamel says as we both back away.<br>
“No, just watch.”<br>
He plays a note, which pierces my ears. Me and not-Chamel cover our ears quickly.<br>
But it was still the loudest noise in existence and ever created and it hurt like all hell.<br>
When it eventually trailed off… nothing but a ringing.<br>
Also, Chamel had disintegrated.<br>
I try to talk to not-Chamel. Well, that’s great. But even though I could move my mouth and feel my voice, I couldn’t hear it.<br>
Awesome. Thanks, Chamel.<br>
<br>
Me and not-Chamel move away quickly, making sure to keep watch of every direction as we couldn’t hear anything. Eventually the ringing subsided enough, and we had moved far enough away.<br>
<br>
“Hey, I never got your name,” I say.<br>
“What?” they said.<br>
“I never got your name,” I enunciated.<br>
“Oh. Phi.”<br>
“Nice to meet you, Phi.”<br>
<br><br>


    <h1>002: The Tale of Frostbite</h1>
They lock the door to the room while she watches, holding her arm to her chest. Her hand was blackened. Cold, numb, frostbitten.<br>
<br>
“What the hell is happening?” she says.<br>
<br>
Then she starts seeing something her friend hasn’t done before.<br>
They begin muttering something. Symbols glow on the door.<br>
<br>
“That should hold them off,” they say once they finish.<br>
<br>
They turn to their friend. “Alright. Mev. How’s your hand?” Then they actually look at Mev’s hand, and their red eyes widen. “Uh, that’s rhetorical.”<br>
<br>
“Neri, tell me what the hell is going on.”<br>
<br>
Neri purses their lips and just looks at Mev for a bit.<br>
<br>
“I’m gonna try to help your hand, and then I’ll try to explain everything,” they say. “Alright?”<br>
<br>
Mev stares at them. Then she takes a deep breath. “Fine.”<br>
<br>
Neri approaches Mev slowly. “Okay.”<br>
<br>
They start muttering something again. Her hand starts glowing.<br>
<br>
The feeling begins to come back. She moves a finger slightly —<br>
<br>
“Not yet,” Neri says. Mev complies.<br>
<br>
Her hand gets warm. At first she thinks it’s the glowing.<br>
But it keeps getting warmer. And warmer. And it burns, it burns, it burns--<br>
<br>
“Stop, you’re burning me!” Mev shouts.<br>
“What?” Neri says, confused, backing away. The glowing stops, but the burning persists. The hand has its feeling back, but it’s still blackened.<br>
<br>
“It’s burning, my hand is burning!”<br>
“Shit. The spell’s attached to you.”<br>
“Attached?!”<br>
“It’s created a permanent effect. Sometimes this happens. I can’t reverse it at this point.”<br>
<br>
Mev backs away slowly.<br>
<br>
“Mev…” Neri starts.<br>
<br>
“What’s happening?” Mev says.<br>
<br>
Neri lets out a breath.<br>
<br>
“Those things are called Livids. Magical beings. Insanely dangerous. They create traps. They try to steal your soul.” A pause. “I…”<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
Neri takes a breath. “Usually they stay pretty hidden, but… I don’t get why they’re so… out there. Spread out. Doing whatever the hell this is.”<br>
<br>
Mev breathes in sharply. A siren can be heard in the distance, and both turn toward a window.<br>
<br>
“I’m--” Neri whispers, nervous. “I’m one of them.”<br>
<br>
They turn back to each other. Silence.<br>
<br>
“And you’re on my side?” Mev says.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” Neri says. “Yeah, I am.”<br>
<br>
“Good.”<br>
<br>
“I’m going to get you out of this. Mev, I am going to get you out of this alive. Alright?”<br>
<br>
“Alright,” Mev whispers.<br>
