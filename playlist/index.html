    <p>Electronic artist with a slightly eccentric style. Yeah, he made the Minecraft music. He made a little bit more than the Minecraft music. It's worth checking out literally everything else. <b class="startwith">I'd start with 148, but I'm biased and also every album is different.</b></p>

    <p>Alternative-ish (i mean, alternative is already a genre that gets stretched out) but also kinda pop and also autotune is pretty cool and also breakcore-ish stuff is pretty cool. <b class="startwith">Start with Running.</b></p>
