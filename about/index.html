    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
        Hey, I'm <b>Wish Volo</b> (he/him), and I make a bunch of stupid stuff in my free time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm an aspiring, in-over-my-head ambitious gamedev/musician/YouTube guy/artist.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I don't really have a lot to say. The rest of the content on my site probably says more about me. Once I make it, of course.
    </p>

    <h2>COOL THINGS</h2>
    <p>I like playing video games and listening to music quite a lot of the time. You can see the kind of music I listen to on the Playlist page.</p>
    <p>My favorite video game is <a href="https://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a>. That is the most definitive thing I can say about something being my favorite.</p>

    <h1>SITE NAVIGATION / INFO</h1>
    <p>To be honest I don't really know what I'm doing with this. Maybe it's cause I want it to feel like all the other Neocities sites on here. Whatever.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>CONTENT</b> - General purpose collection for stuff I've made. It has filters for games, music, videos, art, and a catch-all just in case.</p>
    <p><b>CHARACTERS</b> - List of characters I have. woo! goobers!</p>
    <p><b>NOW DRAW THEM...</b> - I take goofy requests for short, silly drawings of myself or other characters! (Within reason.)</p>
    <p><b>Q \ A</b> - If you have questions, I might have answers.</p>
    <p><b>PLAYLIST</b> - All of the music I have on my main playlist, sorted by artist and listed as a bunch of gradient squares for albums.</p>
    <p><b>ABOUT</b> - ... Heyyyyyy</p>
    <br>
